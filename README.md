# Machine-learning

A playground repository for practicing the coding of different methods and aspects of machine learning and probability theory. The project contains implementations of some common ML algorithms and probability-related concepts. Some examples:

    - Linear regression (ML),
    - Polynomial regression (ML),
    - Regression using basis function (Gauss RBF),
    - Logistic regression (ML),
    - Polynomial Logistic regressions (ML),

    - Normal distribution PDF and CDF,
    - Laplace distribution PDF and CDF
    - Exponential distribution PDF and CDF.
